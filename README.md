# -MultiKinect-in-TouchDesigner
Use this interface to connect and display instance data from 5 Kinect sensors

# -Hello everyone!
In this repo you will find a base version of the system we used for Neon Indian Live performance during the CMJ conference in NYC in 2015.

To use the system you must have a licenced TouchDesigner software.
This system was tested and ran successfuly on this spec:

Nvidia GeForce 980
24gb RAM
3 x USB Bus
500GB SSD Drive

## -This setup looks at 5 Kinect sensors - 4xV1 sensors and 1xV2 

When you launch the application you'll notice kinect depth camera windows on left. There you can also specify which window looks through which sensor. Before launching TouchDesigner make sure your system can see all the devices ( make sure all are distributed on different USB buses, specifically the V2 needs to run on its own )

Please refer also to the PDF attached // this is what we sent out with the Neon Indian crew on tour.
